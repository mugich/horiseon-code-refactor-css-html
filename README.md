# Code refactor for Horiseon Web site

## Project Description

In this project as developer I needed to refactor existing code without changing what it looks like and what it does.  
The reason why I refactored the existing code is to make the website to have a better accessbility and impelemented a new technology according the accesiblity standards. 
I changed the HTML files to make it clearer and simpler. Also changed  the CSS files to make it more organized. 
By doing this, the website to become one of the accessible sites which are better positioned in search engines like Google. 

**Technologies used:** I improved it by changing the generic tags into sementic elements Within the HTML files. 
By changing these elements I made it clearly define its contents. 

**Semantic Elements used:**

-     <main></main>
-     <aside></aside>
-     <figure></figure>
-     <footer></footer>
-     <header></header>
-     <nav></nav>
-     <section></section>

Since it was my very first project, it was somewhat challenging. I had to to a lot of research and referenced some websites to get ideas. 
The following are the links to those sites:
