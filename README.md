# Code refactor for Horiseon Web site

## Project Description

In this project as developer I needed to refactor existing code without changing what it looks like and what it does.  
The reason why I refactored the existing code is to make the website to have a better accessbility and impelemented a new technology according the accesiblity standards. 
I changed the HTML files to make it clearer and simpler. Also changed  the CSS files to make it more organized. 
By doing this, I made the website to become one of the accessible sites which are better positioned in search engines like Google. 

**Technologies used:** I improved it by changing the generic tags into sementic elements Within the HTML files. 
By changing these elements I made it clearly define its contents. 
Semantic Elements used:
- <main>
- <aside>
- <figure>
- <footer>
- <header>
- <nav>
- <summary>

Since it was my very first project, it was somewhat challenging. I had to to a lot of research and referenced some websites to get ideas. 
The following are the links to those sites:
